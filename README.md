# TrentonEats Project 
Trenton Eats, a web application created in partnership with the Trenton Eats Local Club, was made in response to the decline of the restaurant industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in response to the difficulties faced by local restaurants in Trenton. The web app allows users to view a list of local restaurants in Trenton, displaying details such as opening hours, directions, location, etc. while also facilitating rating and reviewing for each restaurant (among other features).. Local restaurant owners can also fill out a form to add their restaurant to the website, providing them an opportunity to advertise their restaurants to consumers. Unlike other “Find a Restaurant” websites, Trenton Eats is specific to Trenton, catering to local restaurants in terms of helping them promote their business  as well as consumers looking to eat and support businesses in Trenton.

The application was initiatally deployed on :

Update: January 19, 2023
The project sort of fell apart after confusion of who was going to maintain the application. One day, I hope to pick the project back up. As a result, noone is paying for the website to be maintained. 

1) The Database -> originally used Heroku's free database program, but that fell apart when all heroku databases got deleted. 
2) Google Maps Api key = cannot get restaurant location features. 

I am currently working on making the file run locally.
